Project Description :

School Management System is designed for educational institutes like primary school,
secondary and higher secondary school  or other public institutes 
and also private institutes to manage academic activities more accurate and  faster than manual system.


School Management System is a such service that reduces most of the drawbacks of the traditional methods.
The system is web based so Student admission, Employee Registration,Attendance,
 payroll, result publishing are totally automatic. Thus, it minimizes the time and human effort by accurate performance. 
A person can check student information, notices, result etc.

This Web based application will facilitate a school by performing following tasks-
Administrative panel, Admit Student, Employ Teacher, Parent Information, Class management, Exam and Result management
Administrative Panel will operate the system.There are various types of user of this system. Each of the user will access the system according to their provided (by admin) rules.
Teacher can submit marks in his/her subject and generate student result.

Although we tried by heart and soul in our limited time most of the task we completed succesfully
and some feature couldn't add yet like attendance, dynamic class routine and Mark generation.These are under proccessing.
